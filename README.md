# Retrospective
At this point I think I would more closely emulate Kinesis's thumb clusters so I could just copy their layouts.

I would also give some of the keys more room so I didnt have to grind down the amoeba pcb's in the tighter areas.

A Heart felt THANK YOU to all those who have contributed to my project as well as all the repos that allow such a project to even exist.
